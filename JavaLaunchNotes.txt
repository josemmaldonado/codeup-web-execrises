Who: 
	Java is an OBJECT ORIENTED language that is almost everywhere

What:
	Java Compared to JavaScript:


    Java is compiled while JavaScript is interpreted.
    Java is statically typed while JavaScript has dynamic typing.
    While JavaScript does have objects, there is much more focus on them in Java, and the way they are defined and used is quite different.
    JavaScript runs (mostly) in the browser, while Java runs almost everywhere.
    Java is "lower" as a language vs Javascript being "higher"
